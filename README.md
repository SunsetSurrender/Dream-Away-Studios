As I am a producer and sound engineer I wanted this Code Academy (Company Home Page) to be a basic and responsive layout for what will eventually become the landing page for my production, sound design and mixing & mastering services. 
I am quite new in the world of web development, so feel free to leave any comment, tip or improvement that you can think of, it will help me immensely! 

Finally, if you're curious about my music, you can check me out on all major streaming platforms @sunsetsurrender.
